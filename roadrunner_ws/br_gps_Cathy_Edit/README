When you first plug in the GPS, type 

	stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 speed 4800

This will change baud rate of the GPS to 4800 instead of the default, 9600.

You can then navigate to gpsd_client where the launch file is.
Type 
	roslaunch gpsd_client GPS_Launch.launch

This will run all of the files. 

I am currently sending the commands "F 90\r" to drive forward, "R 21\r" to turn right and "F 0\r" to stop.

driving happens in gps_common/src/utm_odometry_node.cpp
That should be the only file you need to fix. 
It publishes to psoc_tx

*NOTE* the gps must be outside to work.
